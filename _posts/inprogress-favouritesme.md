As I said in my [last blog article](favourites-me) on this, I'm in the process of splitting off the core functionality from my webapp [favourites.me](https://favourites.me) into a standalone typescript package / library. 

This isn't just going to make it easier for me to maintain the website, but it's also going to make my eventual React Native apps so much easier. Separating the UI from the core functionality is something I should always have done, but I wanted to get a minimum viable product out there, so the current state of the webapp is a mishmash of UI elements and media management logic.
