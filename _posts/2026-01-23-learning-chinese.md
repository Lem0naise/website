Despite actually having Indian heritage, I somehow look about as white as a person can get. Along with the most London English accent imaginable, that's me. 

However, languages have always fascinated me. I started with French at a young age, and for some bizarre reason, decided to teach myself Russian when I was about 14. I got lucky; my school had a teacher willing to give me one-on-one lessons for A-Level, which was honestly a game-changer.

Now, as a 2026 resolution, I want to set my sights on something that feels borderline impossible: learning Chinese (Mandarin, I guess?). Russian has been challenging, but incredibly rewarding. But with the way the world is going, and considering the practicality of travel, safety, communication, Chinese just seems like a much more useful language to have.

Let's be real: this is probably a terrible idea. My attempt at learning Japanese was an absolute disaster (I still have nightmares about kanji), and Chinese is hardly known for being easy. The tones, the characters, the sheer number of words that sound exactly the same.

But that's kind of the point, I want to see if I can push through the initial confusion and actually make some progress.
So, here we go. Let's see how this goes.
