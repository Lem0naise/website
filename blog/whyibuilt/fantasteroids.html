                        This was one of my first ever projects, and definitely the first 'big' one. I built it while I was still in school, so it took <em>a while</em>. The thing I'm most proud of, though, was that I finished it, at least to a level I was satisfied with. Every developer knows the easiest part of a project is starting it, and the last 20% is the absolute hardest thing you will ever do.

                    <p>
                        I have always played a lot of video games, and after visiting the <a href="https://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/see-and-do/power">London Science Museum</a> (highly recommend), where I got to play classic games like Pong and Pacman, I got the itch that you will know all too well - that itch to create something.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So, I went home and booted up my laptop. My only experience in game-making at that point was dozens of unfinished Unity projects, thanks to the wizard that is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlKaB1etrik">Brackeys</a> (I owe so much of my childhood to that man!). For some reason, I had recently discovered <a href="https://godotengine.org/">Godot</a> and played around with a bit, and after thinking for a bit, I decided why not, and chose to make this new, yet-unnamed project, in Godot. It's open-source, had a lot fewer tutorials and was a lot less well-known at the time, but why not, give myself another challenge.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I know now in hindsight that working in a team makes everything easier. Despite that, I came home most nights from school, opened Godot, and kept tapping away at the keyboard. I had decided by that point to make an asteroids-inspired game. It was originally going to be a rhythm game, where you had to dodge asteroids which would fall from the sky to the beat of a song, but after some quick googling I discovered the terrors that are music licensing laws, and I quickly pivoted to a more traditional random asteroid style.
                    </p>
					<p>
						Before long, I had a working demo. Soon enough, I was working on the project on the terrible PCs in the library. I would bring a Godot executable and the game files on a USB stick and plug it in, and tap away for hours. After a couple of weeks of doing this at lunchtimes, a classmate of mine saw me, came up to me, and we started talking. It turns out he was a remarkably good artist with a knack for pixel art, and we soon began collaborating on the game. To this day, he is still one of my best friends! 
					</p>
					<p>
						A lot of the art I drew myself. Every time I'd draw something, I'd send it to him on Discord and he'd send back an alternate version for me to pick from. I would say that about 50% of the assets are mine and 50% are his. My greatest idea was, in a typical move done by mobile app developers, 'add hundreds of skins!'. Because the gameplay loop was relatively simple, I thought a great way to show the achievement of progress would be via skins, and I would like to say I was right. This also meant it was easy to pump lots of new art into the game - if you want to draw something, just add a new skin! We added dozens of skins this way, and that is his main contribution to the game.
					</p>

					<p class="caption">The clock was one of the first skins I drew, and I liked it so much it's basically all I ever play with myself. It was so fun to draw!</p>

					<img src="blog/cat.png" class="pixel-image">
					<p class="caption">You can't make a set of skins without a cat!</p>

					<p>The next thing to work on was music! I composed one of the music tracks myself, and one of them was acquired from a random royalty-free source online - it was just too good in my mind at the time to pass up. I had so much fun in Fruity Loops Studio, but only ended up with one track that my friends didn't all immediately pile onto as terrible music, so that's the one I used.</p>

					<h2>Steam Integration</h2>
					
					<p>After making an initial working demo, I decided quite quickly I wanted to publish the game on Steam. This would both give me an exciting project to announce, and also give me a final goal to work towards, thereby making me more likely to finish it.</p>
					
					<p>After making an account on the Steamworks Developer Portal (or whatever they call it nowadays), the 'Leaderboards' button caught my eye. After reading up on the page a little, I decided I would definitely add Steam leaderboards into the game - just like a traditional arcade game, leaderboards are what drives it. You would go back again and again to the arcade to try and beat your friends' high scores, and I think leaderboards create a huge sense of friendly competition and community engagement.</p>
					<p>
						The Steam APIs are not super easy to work with, but after weeks and weeks of bugfixing, I got steam leaderboards to work! Wonderful. We are getting close to release time!
					</p>

					<h2>Release And Beyond</h2>
					<p>
						The days leading up to the release were exciting. I'd decided on a date, and I kept advertising it in person, I'm sure I was extremely annoying at school, but anything to get the word out there. I'd chosen to make it free instead of paid, even though the idea of earning a little money was definitely attractive to me, I just knew that I would get infinitely more engagement if I made it free, and it was really for practice and fun anyway!
					</p>
					<p>
						When the release date arrived, I was absolutely thrilled. It felt like I was finally getting my creativity out into the world, something I had procrastinated for a decade and more! I'd spent so long working on it in a bubble that it was a huge rush to see people I knew, and even complete strangers, download and play it!
					</p>
					<p>
						That was the best part about a Steam release. You get on all of the Steam new game pages, if only for a day or so, and the online presence means you're found by web scrapers - there are a handful of YouTube videos about the game, gameplay, trailers, you name it!
					</p>
					<p>
						I was temporarily caught out by the sudden influx of (merely dozens) of international people playing my game - the pixel font I had chosen for the leaderboard didn't support non-Latin characters! Worst of all, the new top player on the leaderboard was Korean, and their name wasn't even being shown! I quickly wrote a hotfix to substitute the font, and the Korean player got their dignity back. (I think they're still top to this day - incredibly impressive playing, shout out to them. See if you can beat them!) 
					</p>

					<h2>
						What I Learned
					</h2>
					<p>The most important thing I learnt was the power of finishing a project, and how much easier it is with friends. Collaboration boosts your productivity immensely, and humans much prefer working with others, especially for long-term projects, than alone.</p>
					<p>
						Community was also incredible - I was right to make it free, and I was doubly right to add Steam leaderboards - seeing people from all over my school, the country, and even the world, play this little game I made in my free time, was such a joyous feeling.
					</p>

					<p>Fantasteroids was my first big leap into the world of game development, in fact any development at all. It's not perfect, definitely not, but it's a testament to what's possible when I actually finish the projects I start.</p>
