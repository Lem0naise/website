				<p class="blog-subtitle">My blog posts are random observations and musings - don't take anything seriously, I'm not an expert. Do not expect routine - I am the world's most inconsistent poster. Sometimes I write short stories too - I make myself publish them here so that I have to finish them. Some may be good, some may be terrible. I hope to improve as I practice.</p>

					<!--- To write: 
					
					Tabs vs Spaces Debate

					Why every app wants to be a platform, feature creep 
					related:
					the joy of a single-purpose device
					

					tech doesnt have to be so loud, apps with bright colours and loud music
					
					First past the post grievances
					Gerrymandering UX design (through design lens)

					The UX of lifts - why close door buttons don't actually close the door
					Skeuemorphism? ^
					Why people love terrible tools they are used to (Excel macros?)
					User onboarding vs indoctrination / gaslighting
					the weirdest settings in every app i use
					the setting i always turn off first (autoplay videos, vibrate, etc)

					404s, cookies, spam -> strange metaphors
					
					the joy of really specific words
					Why we say 'dialing' a phone number - fossil words? (what is bcc, cc)

					The Rise and Fall of Esperanto (ambitious linguistic projects)
					Why is Python named after a snake? (etymology of tech terminology)
					language is just a lossy compression algorithm (speak, hear, comprehend, etc)
					placeholder words in different languages (like whatchamacallit)
					
					the archeology of a filename (draft.docx to Final_Report_v3_USE_THIS_ONE_(Indigo_edits).d)

					cool and tiny petitions

					public transport musings, colours, design of bus stops, paths, trains etc
