					<p>
						You have no doubt found yourself saying "pass me the... uh... thingy" when you really mean the water jug, or saying the "thingamajig" to describe some screw or bolt which probably has a name, but you've long forgotten it. Placeholder words like these hold a very important place in language. Having the ability to say "that thing" and "you-know-who" allows conversations to flow smoother, and prevents a breakdown in communication by providing a fallback to rely on. They're a part of <em>pragmatic language</em> - conveying intention and context, signalling "you know what I mean". All languages have these placeholder words for when we don't know or can't remember the right time.
					</p>
					<p>
						But have you ever thought of what these terms are in different langauges? Surely Germans don't say "doohickey" in a German accent, right? I was curious about this too, so I decided to do some research and explore this.
					</p>

					<h2>English</h2>
					
					<p>
						Let's begin with English, to provide a sort of overview. I've listed below a non-comprehensive list of nonsense words, which I will reference back to when attempting to translate other languages' equivalents.
					</p>
					<ul class="column-2">
						<li>Thingamajig</li>
						<li>Doohickey</li>
						<li>Whatchamacallit</li>
						<li>Thingamabob</li>
						<li>Doodad</li>
						<li>Whatsit</li>
						<li>Whosit</li>
						<li>Gizmo</li>
						<li>Doobry</li>
						<li>So-and-so</li>
						<li>Gubbins</li>
						<li>You-know-who</li>
						<li>Whats-his-face</li>
					</ul>
					<h2>Germanic Languages</h2>

					<h3>German</h3>
					<ul>
						<li><code>Dort, wo der Pfeffer wächst</code> - "where the pepper grows", refers to a very far away place</li>
						<li><code>Schlag mich tot</code> - "strike me dead", often said while talking and you cannot remember the word you're looking for</li>
						<li><code>Wo Fuchs und Hase sich gute Nacht sagen</code> - "where the fox and rabbit say good night to each other", said when you are utterly lost and in the middle of nowhere.</li>
						<li><code>zig Mal</code> - "umpteen", as in an exagerrated uncountable number of times </li>

					</ul>
					<h3>Dutch</h3>

					<p>
						Dutch is similar to English or German: it features words such as
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li><code>hoe-heet-het</code>: frequently translated as 'thingamabob' and 'whatsit'.</li>
					</ul>
