						You probably use your phone too much. I know I do. If I'm bored, I check Twitter (or X, if you want), check my WhatsApp messages, or scroll Instagram. Looking at my screentime is a scary thought, even though I do honestly try to consciously reduce it.
					</p>
					<p>
						Somewhere, I had read that one of the reasons social media was so addictive was how colourful it was. The colours grab your attention, and the vibrant moving images keep hold of it. Bright red notification badges screaming for you to click on them. Now, I use my phone in colourblind mode (on account of my colourblindness), but while exploring my phone's colour settings, I found an entirely 'Black and White' toggle. This immediately piqued my curiosity. What would happen if I drained my phone of colour? Not permanently of course, but just to see if what I thought was true. I discovered while googling this, that <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/grayscale-ios-android-smartphone-addiction/" target="_blank">this idea was backed by science</a>. So, I turned the setting on, and began my experiment.
					</p>
					<h2>
						The First Day
					</h2>
					<p>
						Funnily, one of the first things I noticed was how colourful the world became. I spent half an hour or so scrolling Twitter, and then looked up - in comparison to the dim, drained phone screen, the world was so colourful. This was not even the main intent of the experiment, but was a pleasant and kind of heartwarming side effect that I noticed.
					</p>
					<p>
						I did once have a bit of a moment - I was taking a photo of a flower while on a walk, and kept getting frustrated at the lack of colour, until about five seconds later when I realised it wasn't my camera, it was - obviously - my screen.
					</p>

					Reduce how often check phone
					Get bored faster
					Eyes feel better
					Felt more calming
					Messages, emails, feel the same

					Moments when i wanted colours back - photo editing, using videos, etc
					Colour-coded elements in apps - we really shouldn't have them!

					Psychology of colour? Colour guide attention

					<h2>
						What I Learnt
					</h2>
					<p>
						I have, regrettably, since returned to using my phone in full colour. The experience nevertheless gave me a new awareness
						I would highly recommend trying this for yourself. It's minimal effort, easy to find on most phones, and shows surprisingly effective results.
