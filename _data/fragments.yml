    > I'm free / to do what I want / any old time

    > I'm free / to be who I choose / any old time

    A recurring theme here is that we have free will. But genuinely, you are free to do what you want and be who you choose. In a world where you can be anything, choose to be kind.

    It is easy to get disillusioned with the constant cycle of life, losing things, searching for things, finding things, and then losing them again. You need to re-establish your priorities, what you actually want for yourself, before you dive into the world.

    A flatmate introduced me to this song because of how similar it was vibes-wise to Souvenir by Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark. She was right, and I love the song.

    I can't remember where I read it, but someone said that if you did something as simple as going to the supermarket and experienced it genuinely and fully without the 'goggles of habit' you would simply go crazy with pure joy and overwhelming sensory experiences.

    Nowadays, everything is taken for granted. We can have next-day, even same-day delivery, on millions of tiny trinkets that we don't really need. We can have milk, cheese, meat, anywhere in the country, fresh, within an hour of anywhere. Every day. It is worth sometimes taking off the goggles of habit and appreciating how far we've come.

    It is too easy to pretend we are infallible. We are not, nobody is. We all make mistakes, we all do things wrong. You have to own it and make sure you don't spiral.

    > There isn't much / That I feel I need / A solid soul / And the blood I bleed

    At the end of the day, if you retain your humanity, everything will be fine. You can lose your job, your partner, your friends, move country, break both legs and arms, shave your head, fail all your exams, but if you still view yourself as a person capable of being redeemed, it will work out in the end.

    You probably already know I don't agree with this worldview. Fate is not real, and we can bend destiny if we try hard enough and are strong enough to withstand the consequences.

    > The feeling has gone, only you and I, it means nothing to me 

    Apparently, Midge Ure didn't like the vibe of this song, and when he heard it in the studio, said 'this means nothing to me'. So, he sang that. And what a great song it made.

    To everything there is a season, and a time to every purpose. Everything has its time and place. You cannot be happy without being sad, because what is happiness without the comparison to your sadness? Somebody who is always happier is much less happy than somebody who finds happiness temporarily and sometime, like we all do.

    Love can be stretched to its extremes when confronted with financial problems. It does not always mean that the love is not strong enough if the relationship doesn't last. Financial problems are a cruelty unique to the world we live in, and we only have one life to live.

    It's important to maintain the impression that everything is going okay even when it's not. That isn't to say don't ask for help - your friends can help you through dark times and even save your life. But if you have the mindset that you *will* be okay and you *will* make it through, and there's no other feasible possiblity, then you've just greatly improved your chances. It's how Doctor Who survives all of their encounters - they simply *survive*, and work backwards from there.

   > I could build me a castle with memories just to have somewhere to go

   > Count the days and the nights that it / Takes to get back in the saddle again
   
   There is a strange calmness in desolation. 'Tired of running round looking for answers to questions I already know' speaks to what many people suffering from depression will know. The condition is internal, not external. The causes, the pressure, they are external, sure, but the condition and the state is self-imposed and internal. You can be acutely self-aware of this, and exhausted and frustrated with yourself, but continue because you simply have no other choice. 
   
   It is very hard to move past this and take responsibility, especially if you are surrounded by the same conditions which led you here in the first place. 
   
   Once you have been left with nothing, like we are in the song, it is somehow easier - with nothing to lose, there is everything to gain. Getting 'back in the saddle again' is not a triumphant victory over mental illness, nor a angry spiteful move, but a resigned necessity - there is simply nothing else that one can do other than get in the saddle again.

    > Just do it / Just do it

    Things are always easier with friends around you, I've said this a lot. But sometimes you won't have that luxury. You have to get through it. You have to persevere through difficulty, you have to recognise your power to make a choice without the support of everybody around you, trust your own vision even if you feel alone in it, and act decisively. Some opportunities don't come back.
