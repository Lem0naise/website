    A flatmate introduced me to this song because of how similar it was vibes-wise to Souvenir by Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark. She was right, and I love the song.

    > If I had a photograph of you / Or something to remind me / I wouldn't spend my life just wishing

    Wishing - A Flock of Seagulls

    > My feelings still remain / My feelings still remain

    > Then put your little hand in mine / There ain't no hill or mountain we can't climb

    > Okay campers, rise and shine! And don't forget your booties 'cause it's cold out there today!

    I Got You Babe - Sonny & Cher. Groundhog Day is an over-hated film. Watch it if you haven't. This song is absolutely incredible.

    > You're dead but the world keeps spinning

    Events keep happening after you die. People are born, other people die, warring countries make peace, other countries go to war. Politicians rise and fall, culture shifts and warps, and all of it while you're gone. Don't die too early, you'll miss life going by.

    It's human nature to constantly think about the future - it's good to practice not doing that.

    > A time to be born, a time to die
    >
    > A time to plant, a time to reap
    >
    > A time to kill, a time to heal
    >
    > A time to laugh, a time to weep

    To everything there is a season, and a time to every purpose. Everything has its time and place. You cannot be happy without being sad, because what is happiness without the comparison to your sadness? Somebody who is always happier is much less happy than somebody who finds happiness temporarily and sometime, like we all do.

    > Oh, and our good time starts and end / without dollar one to spend

    Love can be stretched to its extremes when confronted with financial problems. It does not always mean that the love is not strong enough if the relationship doesn't last. Financial problems are a cruelty unique to the world we live in, and we only have one life to live.

    > How can you love me when you never get to see me / You might know me now but I used to I used to be fun 

    I used to be fun - Teen Jesus and the Jean Teasers. Discovered this band through a round of [Music League](https://musicleague.com/) for 'most ridiculous band names'. Good song.

    > When you get that feeling / It's gonna get you / It's gonna get you in the end

    I saw The Farm's reunion tour last week, and it was excellent. Considering how long it's been since their last album, I'm very satisfied.

    Some things are inevitable. Fighting them can just make them worse. Prepare instead.

    > You can't start a fire without a spark / This gun's for hire / Even if we're just dancing in the dark

    You cannot start life at Level 100. You cannot play the piano without learning it. You cannot do anything without starting it as a total beginner - and everybody did the same at some point.
    
    Dancing in the Dark - Bruce Springsteen

    As Sam Reich from CollegeHumour / Dropout says best:

    > The only way to learn is by playing, the only way to win is by learning, and the only way to begin is by beginning

    > If there's anything that you want / If there's anything I can do / Just call on me and I'll send it along / With love from me to you

    Friends are everything. Make connections if it's the only thing you do. The worst thing you can do is get a high-paying career, get incredibly fit, stay healthy, but have nobody to talk to, to confide in, who will help you when you need it.

    > If I ever lose my eyes / Oh well, I won't have to cry no more / Yes I'm being followed by a moonshadow

    We often spend too much energy creating an imaginary persona to front to others, time that could be invested into bettering ourselves and adopting the persona we wish we had.

    It can be easy to feel stuck in a cycle of loneliness and disappointment. Days can merge into each other. It's important to take back agency of your own life.

    Life has its ups and downs, we all know this. But nothing is quite like seeing your own actions cause ups, and prevent downs. Keep taking care of yourself, and soon the day will come when things fall into place.

    > Got to keep on going like it ain't the end / Got to change like your life is depending on it

    It's important to maintain the impression that everything is going okay even when it's not. That isn't to say don't ask for help - your friends can help you through dark times and even save your life. But if you have the mindset that you *will* be okay and you *will* make it through, and there's no other feasible possiblity, then you've just greatly improved your chances. It's how Doctor Who survives all of their encounters - they simply *survive*, and work backwards from there.
